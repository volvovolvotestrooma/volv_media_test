#export to file 
mysqldump -u my_username -p database_name > output_file_path.sql
-u and -p flags are required for authentication
which is then followed by the name of the database to import into 


#copy file  machine to other 
	scp localmachine/path_to_the_file username@server_ip:/path_to_remote_directory
	or synchronize existnig file  
	rsync -rvc -e ssh -p 3310  --progress  /home/user/Downloads/testfeed.sql  user@ip:/tmp/


#Importing to file 
 mysqlimport -u book_admin -p books_production ~/backup/database/books.sql
	-u and -p flags are required for authentication
