11) Why do we use LIKE operator when we have where clause in SQL?

Ans) 

The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

% - The percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple characters
_ - The underscore represents a single character

[] Any single character search with the specified pattern

[^] Any single character search not within the specified range
