1) what is the difference between == & === operators

Ans) 
	==    Checks for equality between two arguments performing type conversion when necessary:
		1 == "1" results in true
		1 == 1 results in true


	===  Identical to               Same as == but the types of the operands have to match.
		 No automatic type conver-sions are performed:
		1 === "1" results in false.
		1 === 1 results in true.
